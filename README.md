# C++ Projects and Algorithm Examples

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects focused on fundamental algorithm implementations. These projects are created for learning, experimenting, and practicing core C++ concepts.

## 📁 Contents

### 🔷 Riemann Sum Calculator
An implementation of the Riemann sum approximation to estimate the area under a curve. The program allows customization of:

- Function to integrate (via code modification)
- Interval `[a, b]`
- Number of subdivisions (rectangles)

It supports left, right, and midpoint Riemann sums.

### 🔷 Matrix Generator
A custom algorithm that generates a matrix based on specific rules. The matrix may follow a certain pattern or logic (e.g., diagonals, symmetry, progression, etc.) defined in the code.

This is useful for:

- Practicing nested loops
- Understanding multi-dimensional arrays
- Exploring matrix logic and generation techniques
